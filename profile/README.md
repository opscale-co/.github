## Our philosophy

Remember the Fibonacci sequence? Just as the sum of two numbers gives the next in the sequence, we see this sequence as a metaphor for creating layers of complexity where the previous layers provide the foundation for greater value. Our software development philosophy is non-technical user-centric, facilitating their interaction with data in an intuitive and efficient manner. We are passionate about creating increasingly specialized layers, our public repos are the layer 0 to create your next big thing. We are cooking the layer 1 for assisting your next Laravel Nova project, get in touch for details!
